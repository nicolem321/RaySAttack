# RaySAttack
RayS Attack(https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12792) ran on 50 samples from the validation set of CIFAR-10 dataset

The project aimed to run the RayS black-box attack (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12792) using 50 samples from the validation set of CIFAR-10 on a classifier of my choice, with additional code and information listed below.
